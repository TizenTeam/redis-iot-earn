# redis-iot
Redis client implementation with pipelining and pubsub on embedded ESP (arduino like) device

I had to disable the Google Chart drawing because each device sends value update at 1500 values/sec,
I expect between 15 and 80 devices in the workshops. And the chart is already unable to refresh with 
only one device.
